      "content": "The FAFSA (Free Application for Federal Student Aid) priority deadline is March 1st each year. Submitting your FAFSA by this date ensures you receive maximum consideration for all available aid, including limited institutional grants and scholarships.\n\nWhy the Priority Deadline Matters:\nMany forms of financial aid are awarded on a first-come, first-served basis. Students who submit their FAFSA after the priority deadline may still receive federal aid, but institutional and state funds may be depleted.\n\nAction Steps:\n1. Create an FSA ID at studentaid.gov if you don't have one (both student and parent need separate IDs)\n2. Gather required documents: Social Security numbers, tax returns, W-2s, and bank statements\n3. Complete the FAFSA online at studentaid.gov starting October 1st\n4. List our school code (001234) to ensure we receive your information\n5. Submit by March 1st for priority consideration\n6. Check your university email for any follow-up requests\n\nAfter Submission:\nYour Student Aid Report (SAR) will be available within 3-5 days. Review it for accuracy and make corrections if needed. Our office will contact you within 2-3 weeks with your financial aid award letter.",
