    "content": "The housing application process at University begins each spring for the upcoming academic year. All incoming first-year students are required to live on campus for their first two years unless they meet specific exemption criteria such as living with immediate family within a 30-mile radius.\n\nTo apply for housing, students must first accept their offer of admission and pay the enrollment deposit. Once completed, they will receive access to the Housing Portal within 3-5 business days. The application requires students to complete a lifestyle questionnaire, select their preferred housing type (traditional double, suite-style, or apartment), and rank their top three residence hall choices.\n\nThe housing application fee is $300, which serves as the security deposit and is refundable upon proper checkout at the end of the housing contract. Students with documented medical needs or disabilities should contact the Office of Accessibility Services to request specific accommodations before submitting their housing application.\n\nApplication deadlines are strictly enforced: March 1st for priority consideration and May 1st for the general deadline. Late applications are accepted on a space-available basis. Students who submit by the priority deadline receive earlier room selection times and have better chances of receiving their preferred assignments.\n\nAfter submitting the application, students will receive a confirmation email with their housing lottery number. This number, combined with the application date, determines the room selection time slot.",

Understanding this system helps students secure their preferred housing assignments.\n\nThe room selection period typically runs from April 15th through April 30th. Selection time slots are assigned as follows: Seniors and juniors select during the first week, sophomores during the second week, and incoming first-year students during the third week. Within each class year, students who submitted applications by the priority deadline receive earlier time slots.\n\nStudents will receive an email notification 48 hours before their assigned selection time with login instructions for the Housing Portal. During your selection window, you can view real-time availability of rooms, see floor plans, and lock in your preferred space. Selections are final once confirmed, though room change requests can be submitted after move-in.\n\nRoommate groups must coordinate their selection times. The group member with the earliest time slot can pull in their roommate(s) during selection, even if the roommate has a later slot. Groups must be linked in the Housing Portal at least 72 hours before the first group member's selection time.\n\nStudents who miss their selection window are automatically placed in available spaces based on their preferences. To avoid this, ensure your contact information is current in the Housing Portal and set reminders for your selection date.",

This tool is available to all students who have submitted their housing application and completed the lifestyle questionnaire.\n\nTo access the Roommate Finder, log into the Housing Portal and navigate to the Roommates tab. The system uses your questionnaire responses to generate a compatibility percentage with other students seeking roommates. You can filter potential matches by gender, sleep schedule, cleanliness preferences, noise tolerance, and study habits.\n\nThe matching algorithm considers factors such as wake-up and bedtime preferences, attitudes toward guests and visitors, temperature preferences, and whether you prefer a quiet or social environment. Students are encouraged to answer the questionnaire honestly rather than ideally to ensure accurate matches.\n\nOnce you find a potential match, you can send a roommate request through the system. Both students must confirm the pairing before the deadline to be assigned together. You can message potential roommates directly through the portal to get to know each other before committing.\n\nRoommate groups can include 2-4 students depending on the room type selected. All group members must have compatible housing preferences (same residence hall type and room configuration). Groups are automatically dissolved if preferences conflict, so communicate with potential roommates before forming a group.\n\nThe Roommate Finder closes one week before room selection begins. Students without confirmed roommate groups will be matched by the housing office based on questionnaire responses.",

    "content": "Move-in day is an exciting time that requires careful planning. The University assigns specific move-in dates and time slots to ensure a smooth experience for all students and families. Your assigned time will be emailed approximately two weeks before move-in day.\n\nMove-in for fall semester typically occurs over a four-day period in late August. First-year students move in on Thursday and Friday, while returning students arrive Saturday and Sunday. Each student receives a two-hour check-in window. Arriving outside your assigned window may result in extended wait times.\n\nOn your move-in day, follow campus signage to your designated parking area. Volunteers will assist with unloading and provide carts for transporting belongings. After unloading (approximately 15-20 minutes), move your vehicle to the designated long-term parking areas to allow space for other families.\n\nCheck-in takes place in your residence hall lobby. Bring your student ID and a government-issued photo ID. You will receive your room key, access card, and welcome packet containing important information about building policies, emergency procedures, and campus resources.\n\nBefore entering your room, complete the Room Condition Report (RCR) documenting any existing damage or issues. This protects you from charges at move-out. Submit the RCR within 48 hours of move-in through the Housing Portal.\n\nOrientation activities begin the evening of move-in day. Check your email for the welcome week schedule, which includes floor meetings, campus tours, and social events designed to help you connect with your community.",

A mini-fridge (4.5 cubic feet max) and microwave (700 watts max) are permitted; many students opt for the combo rental program offered through the University.\n\nProhibited items include: candles, incense, or open-flame devices; hot plates, toasters, or appliances with exposed heating elements; space heaters; halogen lamps; extension cords (use power strips instead); pets (except approved service animals and emotional support animals with documentation); weapons of any kind; alcohol in first-year residence halls.\n\nItems provided by the University include: bed frame with mattress, desk and chair, dresser, closet or wardrobe, window blinds, and ethernet connection. Do not bring large furniture pieces as rooms are already furnished.\n\nCoordinate with your roommate before move-in to avoid duplicates of shared items like mini-fridges, microwaves, rugs, and TVs.

Provide a detailed description of the issue, including its exact location within your room or common area. You can upload photos to help technicians understand the problem before arriving. Select the appropriate category: electrical, plumbing, heating/cooling, pest control, furniture, locks/keys, or general repairs.\n\nMaintenance requests are categorized by priority: Emergency issues (no heat, flooding, electrical hazards, security concerns) are addressed within 2-4 hours. Urgent issues (hot water problems, broken locks, significant leaks) are handled within 24 hours. Routine requests (minor repairs, furniture issues, cosmetic concerns) are typically completed within 3-5 business days.\n\nFor true emergencies outside business hours, contact Campus Safety at (555) 123-4567. They will dispatch emergency maintenance personnel or take immediate safety measures as needed.\n\nMaintenance staff will enter your room to complete repairs, typically providing 24-hour notice except for emergencies. You do not need to be present, but valuable items should be secured. After completion, you will receive an email confirmation and can provide feedback on the service.\n\nRecurring issues should be reported each time they occur, as this helps identify systemic problems that may require more extensive repairs.",

    "content": "While we encourage students to work through differences with roommates, we understand that sometimes a room change is necessary for a positive living experience. The room change process opens two weeks after the start of each semester to allow time for initial adjustment.\n\nBefore requesting a room change, students should attempt to resolve conflicts through direct communication with their roommate. If issues persist, contact your Resident Advisor (RA) for mediation support. RAs are trained in conflict resolution and can help establish roommate agreements addressing common concerns like noise, guests, cleanliness, and shared space usage.\n\nIf mediation is unsuccessful or the situation involves safety concerns, you may submit a Room Change Request through the Housing Portal. The request requires a written explanation of the situation and whether mediation was attempted. The Housing office reviews requests weekly and responds within 5-7 business days.\n\nRoom changes are granted based on availability and the nature of the request. Priority is given to situations involving safety concerns, documented harassment, or significant lifestyle incompatibilities that cannot be resolved through mediation. Requests based on minor preferences or convenience are accommodated only if space permits.\n\nIf approved, you will receive instructions for your move date and new assignment. Both moves in and out must be completed within the specified timeframe (typically 48-72 hours). Your RA will conduct checkout of your current room and check-in at your new location.\n\nNote that emergency room changes due to safety concerns bypass the standard process.

This plan is ideal for students who eat most meals on campus and prefer the flexibility of eating whenever they want.\n\nThe 14-Meal Plan includes 14 dining hall swipes per week (Monday-Sunday) plus $400 in Flex Dollars. This option works well for students who typically eat two meals per day on campus or frequently eat off-campus on weekends.\n\nThe 10-Meal Plan offers 10 swipes per week plus $600 in Flex Dollars. This plan suits students with irregular schedules or those who prefer more grab-and-go options from campus cafes.\n\nThe Block 175 Plan provides 175 swipes per semester (approximately 11 per week) plus $300 in Flex Dollars. This option offers maximum flexibility for students whose eating patterns vary week to week.\n\nFlex Dollars carry over between fall and spring semesters but expire at the end of the academic year. Unused dining swipes do not carry over to the following week. Guest swipes can be purchased separately or added to any plan.\n\nDining halls accommodate various dietary needs including vegetarian, vegan, halal, kosher, and allergen-free options.
