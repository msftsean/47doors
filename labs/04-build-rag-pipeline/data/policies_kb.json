    "content": "The University is committed to maintaining the highest standards of academic integrity. All students are expected to complete their own work and properly attribute the work of others. Academic integrity is fundamental to the pursuit of knowledge and the credibility of academic credentials.\n\nAcademic integrity violations include, but are not limited to: cheating on examinations, unauthorized collaboration on assignments, fabrication or falsification of data, plagiarism, and facilitating academic dishonesty by others. Students are responsible for understanding what constitutes a violation in each course, as expectations may vary by discipline and assignment type.\n\nFaculty members are required to report all suspected violations to the Office of Academic Integrity. Upon receiving a report, the office will conduct a preliminary review to determine if a formal investigation is warranted. Students will be notified in writing of any allegations and given an opportunity to respond.\n\nThe University uses educational software tools to detect potential violations, including plagiarism detection services and proctoring software for online examinations. Students consent to the use of these tools by enrolling in courses.\n\nAll members of the academic community share responsibility for upholding these standards. Students who witness violations are encouraged to report them through the confidential reporting system. The University prohibits retaliation against anyone who reports a concern in good faith.",

    "content": "Plagiarism is the presentation of another person's words, ideas, data, or creative work as one's own without proper attribution. This includes copying text without quotation marks, paraphrasing without citation, submitting work completed by others, and self-plagiarism (reusing one's own prior work without disclosure).\n\nSanctions for plagiarism are determined based on the severity of the violation, the student's academic history, and whether the violation was intentional. First-time minor violations may result in educational interventions, such as completing an academic integrity module, along with a reduced grade on the assignment.\n\nMore serious violations may result in failure of the assignment, failure of the course, suspension from the University, or permanent expulsion. A notation may be placed on the student's transcript indicating an academic integrity violation.\n\nStudents have the right to appeal sanctions through the Academic Appeals Committee. Appeals must be filed within 10 business days of receiving the sanction decision. The appeals process considers whether proper procedures were followed and whether the sanction is proportionate to the violation.\n\nTo avoid unintentional plagiarism, students should: take careful notes distinguishing their ideas from sources, use citation management software, allow time for revision, and consult with instructors or the Writing Center when uncertain. The library offers workshops on proper citation practices.",

Reports may be submitted by any member of the University community or external parties. The office will review the report and determine whether to proceed with an investigation.\n\nStudents accused of conduct violations will receive written notice of the charges and have the opportunity to meet with a conduct officer. Students may bring an advisor to all meetings. Cases may be resolved through administrative resolution or referred to a conduct board hearing.\n\nSanctions may include: warning, probation, educational requirements, restitution, loss of privileges, residence hall removal, suspension, or expulsion. Sanctions are designed to be educational and proportionate to the violation. Students may appeal decisions through the established appeals process within 5 business days.",

At the University, FERPA rights transfer to students when they enroll, regardless of age. Parents no longer have automatic access to records once a student is enrolled in postsecondary education.\n\nUnder FERPA, students have the right to: inspect and review their education records within 45 days of making a request, request amendments to records they believe are inaccurate or misleading, consent to disclosures of personally identifiable information (with certain exceptions), and file complaints with the U.S. Department of Education.\n\nEducation records include any records directly related to a student that are maintained by the University. This includes grades, transcripts, class schedules, financial aid information, and disciplinary records. FERPA does not cover records kept in the sole possession of the maker, law enforcement records, employment records, or medical records.\n\nThe University may disclose records without consent to: school officials with legitimate educational interest, other schools where the student seeks enrollment, specified officials for audit or evaluation purposes, appropriate parties in connection with financial aid, and in response to court orders or subpoenas.\n\nStudents may authorize release of their records to third parties, including parents, by completing the FERPA Release Form available through the Registrar's Office.

This information may appear in commencement programs, honor roll publications, athletic rosters, and the online student directory.\n\nStudents who do not wish to have their directory information disclosed may submit an opt-out request. To opt out, complete the Directory Information Restriction Form through your student portal or submit a written request to the Registrar's Office. Requests must be submitted by the end of the second week of each semester to be effective for that term.\n\nOpting out means your name will not appear in the commencement program, you will not be included in the online directory, and the University will not verify your enrollment to third parties. This may affect your ability to receive certain services or recognitions.\n\nStudents should carefully consider the implications before opting out. The restriction remains in effect until you submit a written request to remove it. You may modify your directory information restrictions at any time by contacting the Registrar's Office.",

The Office of Disability Services (ODS) coordinates accommodations for eligible students.\n\nTo receive accommodations, students must register with ODS and provide documentation of their disability. Acceptable documentation varies by disability type but generally includes an evaluation from a qualified professional that describes the functional limitations and recommends specific accommodations. ODS will review documentation and meet with students to discuss accommodation needs.\n\nCommon academic accommodations include: extended time on exams, reduced-distraction testing environment, note-taking assistance, accessible formats for course materials, sign language interpreters, and flexible attendance policies for disability-related absences. Housing and dining accommodations are coordinated through separate processes.\n\nOnce approved, students receive an accommodation letter each semester to share with instructors. It is the student's responsibility to deliver accommodation letters and discuss implementation with each instructor at the beginning of the semester. Accommodations are not retroactive.\n\nStudents who believe they have been denied appropriate accommodations may file a grievance with the ADA/504 Coordinator. The University prohibits retaliation against students who request accommodations or file complaints. Faculty and staff questions about implementing accommodations should be directed to ODS.",

The University will respond promptly and equitably to all reports.\n\nUpon receiving a report, the Title IX Office will contact the complainant to discuss supportive measures and reporting options. Supportive measures may include: no-contact orders, academic accommodations, housing changes, counseling referrals, and safety planning. These measures are available regardless of whether a formal complaint is filed.\n\nIf a formal complaint is filed, the University will conduct an investigation following procedures outlined in the Title IX Grievance Policy. Both parties have equal rights throughout the process, including the right to an advisor, access to evidence, and the opportunity to appeal.\n\nConfidential resources are available for those who wish to discuss their options without triggering a University response.

    "content": "Students who believe a final course grade was assigned in error or through unfair processes may appeal through the Grade Appeal Process. Appeals must be based on one or more of the following grounds: computational or clerical error, grade based on factors other than academic performance, inconsistent application of grading standards, or deviation from the syllabus without notice.\n\nAppeals must be initiated within 30 calendar days of the grade posting. The process begins with an informal resolution attempt. Students should first contact the instructor directly to discuss the grade concern. Many issues can be resolved through this conversation.\n\nIf informal resolution is unsuccessful, students may submit a formal written appeal to the department chair. The appeal must include: the course information, the grade received, specific grounds for appeal, supporting evidence, and the desired outcome. The department chair will review the appeal and may meet with both the student and instructor.\n\nIf the department chair's decision is unsatisfactory, students may escalate the appeal to the college dean's office. The dean or designee will conduct a final review and issue a binding decision. The entire appeal process typically takes 4-6 weeks.\n\nGrade appeals do not extend the deadline for academic actions such as graduation applications or financial aid appeals. Students should consult with their academic advisor about potential impacts while an appeal is pending. The burden of proof rests with the student to demonstrate that the grade was improperly assigned.",

Students are placed on academic probation when their cumulative GPA falls below 2.0 or when they fail to meet specific program requirements.\n\nStudents on academic probation must meet with an academic advisor within the first two weeks of the following semester to develop an Academic Success Plan. This plan may include: reduced course load, mandatory tutoring, study skills workshops, and regular check-ins with the advisor. Students on probation may have limitations on extracurricular activities and leadership positions.\n\nTo be removed from probation, students must raise their cumulative GPA to 2.0 or above. Students who fail to meet this standard after one semester on probation will be placed on academic suspension. First suspension is typically for one semester, with longer suspension periods for subsequent occurrences.\n\nStudents may appeal their probation or suspension status if extenuating circumstances affected their academic performance. Appeals must be submitted in writing to the Academic Standards Committee and should include documentation of the circumstances and a plan for future success.\n\nThe University offers resources to help students succeed, including the Academic Success Center, peer tutoring, counseling services, and academic coaching.
