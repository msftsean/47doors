    "url": "https://it.university.edu/kb/password-reset",
    "content": "Forgetting your university password can be frustrating, but resetting it is a straightforward process. There are two primary methods to reset your password depending on your situation.\n\nMethod 1: Self-Service Password Reset\nIf you have previously set up security questions or registered a personal email or phone number, you can use the self-service portal at passwords.university.edu. Click 'Forgot Password' and enter your university ID (typically your student or employee ID number). You will receive a verification code via your registered recovery method. Enter this code and create a new password that meets the university's password requirements: at least 12 characters, including uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.\n\nMethod 2: IT Help Desk Assistance\nIf you cannot access the self-service portal, visit the IT Help Desk in the Library Building, Room 102, or call (555) 123-4567 during business hours (Monday-Friday, 8 AM - 6 PM). You will need to present a valid university ID card for in-person visits. Remote verification requires answering security questions from your student or employee record.\n\nImportant Password Guidelines:\n- Passwords expire every 180 days for security purposes\n- You cannot reuse your last 10 passwords\n- Avoid using personal information like birthdays or names\n- Consider using a passphrase for better security and memorability\n\nAfter resetting your password, remember to update it on all devices where you access university services, including your phone's email app and any saved browser passwords.",

    "content": "Your university email account is essential for receiving official communications, course updates, and collaborating with peers and faculty. This guide will help you set up access to your university email across various platforms.\n\nAccessing Email via Web Browser\nThe easiest way to access your email is through the web portal at mail.university.edu. Log in using your university credentials (your NetID and password). The web interface provides full functionality including email, calendar, contacts, and OneDrive integration.\n\nSetting Up Email on Mobile Devices\niPhone/iPad: Go to Settings > Mail > Accounts > Add Account > Microsoft Exchange. Enter your full university email address (netid@university.edu) and password. The server settings should auto-configure.\n\nAndroid: Open the Gmail app or your preferred email client.

When you reach 90% capacity, you will receive a warning notification. Consider archiving old emails or deleting unnecessary messages to maintain space.\n\nEmail Forwarding\nYou can set up email forwarding to a personal account, but we recommend checking your university email directly to ensure you receive time-sensitive communications. To set up forwarding, log into mail.university.edu, go to Settings > Mail > Forwarding, and enter your preferred address.",

    "content": "Canvas is the university's Learning Management System (LMS) where you access course materials, submit assignments, and participate in discussions. If you're experiencing login problems, this guide will help you resolve common issues.\n\nAccessing Canvas\nCanvas is available at canvas.university.edu. You should log in using your university NetID and password (the same credentials you use for email and other university services).\n\nCommon Login Issues and Solutions\n\n1. Invalid Credentials Error\nIf you receive an 'invalid username or password' message, first verify that you're using your NetID (not your student ID number or personal email). Try resetting your password at passwords.university.edu if you're unsure of your current password.\n\n2. Account Not Found\nNew students may not have immediate Canvas access. Account provisioning typically occurs within 24-48 hours of enrollment confirmation. If you've been enrolled for more than 48 hours and still cannot access Canvas, contact the Registrar's Office to verify your enrollment status.\n\n3. Courses Not Appearing\nIf you can log in but don't see your courses, check that your courses have been published by your instructors. Courses typically become visible 1-2 weeks before the semester starts. Also verify your enrollment through the Student Portal.\n\n4. Browser Compatibility Issues\nCanvas works best with Chrome, Firefox, or Safari (latest versions). If you're experiencing issues, try clearing your browser cache and cookies, or switch to a different browser. Disable browser extensions that might interfere with Canvas functionality.\n\n5. Mobile App Issues\nFor the Canvas mobile app, ensure you're searching for 'University' when selecting your institution during setup. If the app isn't working, try uninstalling and reinstalling it, or use the mobile web browser as an alternative.\n\nIf problems persist after trying these solutions, contact the IT Help Desk or use the live chat feature at it.university.edu/support.",
