## 🤔 Why Multi-Agent Over Monolithic?

When building AI-powered applications, a natural first instinct is to create a single, powerful agent that handles everything. While this works for simple use cases, it quickly becomes problematic as complexity grows.

### ❌ The Monolithic Problem

A single-agent architecture suffers from:

| 🚫 Issue | 📝 Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Prompt Bloat** | System prompts grow unwieldy as you add more capabilities |
| **Context Confusion** | The model struggles to stay focused when handling disparate tasks |
| **Testing Difficulty** | Hard to isolate and test specific behaviors |
| **Maintenance Burden** | Changes to one capability risk breaking others |
| **Cost Inefficiency** | Every request pays for the full prompt, even for simple tasks |

### ✅ The Multi-Agent Solution

Breaking your system into specialized agents provides:

- 🎯 **Separation of Concerns** - Each agent has a clear, bounded responsibility
- 📝 **Focused Prompts** - Shorter, more precise instructions lead to better outputs
- 🧪 **Independent Testing** - Test each agent in isolation
- 📈 **Selective Scaling** - Route simple queries to cheaper/faster models
- 🔍 **Easier Debugging** - Trace issues to specific agents in the pipeline

## 🔄 The Three-Agent Pattern

This accelerator uses a proven three-agent architecture that balances simplicity with power:

```
                                    +------------------+
                                    |   ActionAgent    |
                                    |   (RAG Search)   |
                                    +------------------+
                                           ^
                                           |
+------------------+    +------------------+
|   QueryAgent     |--->|   RouterAgent    |
| (Understanding)  |    |  (Dispatching)   |
+------------------+    +------------------+
        ^                      |
        |                      v
   User Query           +------------------+
                        |   ActionAgent    |
                        |   (API Call)     |
                        +------------------+
                               |
                               v
                        +------------------+
                        |   ActionAgent    |
                        | (Conversation)   |
                        +------------------+
```

### 👥 Agent Responsibilities

#### 🔍 QueryAgent - The Understander

**Purpose:** Transform raw user input into structured, actionable data.

**Responsibilities:**
- 📝 Parse natural language queries
- 🏷️ Extract entities (names, dates, amounts, etc.)
- ✨ Normalize input (fix typos, expand abbreviations)
- 🎯 Identify query type and intent
- 📚 Enrich context with conversation history

| 📥 Input | 📤 Output |
|----------|----------|
| Raw user message + conversation context | Structured query object with intent, entities, and metadata |

#### 🚦 RouterAgent - The Dispatcher

**Purpose:** Determine the best action path for a given query.

**Responsibilities:**
- 🏷️ Classify intent into predefined categories
- ✅ Select appropriate ActionAgent(s)
- ❓ Handle ambiguous queries (ask for clarification)
- 📋 Apply business rules and access control
- 📊 Log routing decisions for analytics

| 📥 Input | 📤 Output |
|----------|----------|
| Structured query from QueryAgent | Routing decision with selected agent(s) and parameters |

#### ⚡ ActionAgent(s) - The Doers

**Purpose:** Execute specific tasks and generate responses.

**Types of ActionAgents:**
- 📚 **RAG Agent** - Searches knowledge bases and synthesizes answers
- 🔗 **API Agent** - Calls external services and transforms responses
- 💬 **Conversation Agent** - Handles chitchat and clarifications
- 📋 **Task Agent** - Performs multi-step workflows

| 📥 Input | 📤 Output |
|----------|----------|
| Routing decision with parameters | Final response to user |

---

## 🛡️ Agent Boundaries and Responsibilities

Clear boundaries between agents are critical. Here is a decision matrix:

| 📋 Concern | 🔍 QueryAgent | 🚦 RouterAgent | ⚡ ActionAgent |
|---------|------------|-------------|-------------|
| Parse user input | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | ❌ No |
| Classify intent | 🔶 Partial | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| Select execution path | ❌ No | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| Call external APIs | ❌ No | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| Generate final response | ❌ No | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| Maintain conversation state | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | 🔶 Partial |

### 🚫 Anti-Patterns to Avoid

1. ❌ **Router doing understanding** - Keep parsing in QueryAgent
2. ❌ **ActionAgent re-classifying** - Trust the router's decision
3. ❌ **QueryAgent calling APIs** - It should only understand, not act
4. ❌ **Circular dependencies** - Agents should not call back to earlier stages

## 🔧 Troubleshooting Tips

### ⚠️ Common Issues

**Issue:** Intent classifier accuracy below 90%
- ✅ **Solution:** Review misclassified examples and add them to training data
- ✅ **Solution:** Check for overlapping intent definitions - make categories more distinct
- ✅ **Solution:** Add more diverse examples per intent (aim for 10+ each)

**Issue:** RouterAgent selecting wrong ActionAgent
- ✅ **Solution:** Verify QueryAgent is extracting correct intent
- ✅ **Solution:** Review routing rules for gaps or conflicts
- ✅ **Solution:** Add explicit handling for edge cases

**Issue:** Prompts generating inconsistent outputs
- ✅ **Solution:** Add output format examples to your prompts
- ✅ **Solution:** Use structured output (JSON) where possible
- ✅ **Solution:** Lower temperature for more deterministic results

**Issue:** Context getting lost between agents
- ✅ **Solution:** Ensure conversation history is passed through pipeline
- ✅ **Solution:** Check that entity extraction preserves all relevant data
- ✅ **Solution:** Add logging to trace data flow between agents

### 📋 Debugging Checklist

### 🧪 Quick Quiz

Test yourself with these scenarios:

1. **Scenario:** A user asks "What's my financial aid status?" and also mentions "my password isn't working"
   - 🔍 Which agent handles parsing both issues?
   - 🚦 How should the RouterAgent handle multiple intents?

2. **Scenario:** The QueryAgent extracts an intent but with only 60% confidence
   - ❓ Should the RouterAgent proceed or ask for clarification?
   - 📊 What factors influence this decision?

3. **Scenario:** An ActionAgent needs information that wasn't in the original query
   - 🔄 Can it call back to QueryAgent to re-parse?
   - ✅ What's the correct pattern to handle this?

**Answers:** Discuss with your coach or check [coach-guide/TALKING_POINTS.md](../../coach-guide/TALKING_POINTS.md) for guidance.
