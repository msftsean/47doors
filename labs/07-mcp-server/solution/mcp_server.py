MCP Server for University Support - Lab 07 Solution

This module implements a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that exposes
university support tools to AI assistants. MCP is an open protocol that
enables AI models to access external tools and data sources in a standardized way.

Key Concepts:
- MCP Server: Provides tools and resources that AI models can use
- Tools: Functions that the AI can call to perform actions or retrieve data
- Resources: Data sources (like files or APIs) that the AI can read
- Prompts: Pre-defined prompt templates for common tasks

This server integrates with previous labs:
- Lab 04: SearchTool for knowledge base queries (RAG)
- Lab 05: AgentPipeline for orchestrated query handling

Architecture:
    AI Assistant (Claude, etc.)

How to Run:

"""
To use this MCP server with VS Code or Claude Desktop, add the following
configuration:

## VS Code Settings (settings.json)

Add to your VS Code settings.json:

{
    "mcp.servers": {
        "university-support": {
            "command": "python",
            "args": ["c:/Users/segayle/repos/edu/47doors/labs/07-mcp-server/solution/mcp_server.py"],

                "AZURE_OPENAI_KEY": "your-api-key",
                "AZURE_SEARCH_ENDPOINT": "https://your-search.search.windows.net",
                "AZURE_SEARCH_KEY": "your-search-key",
                "AZURE_SEARCH_INDEX": "your-index-name"
            }
        }
    }
}


## Claude Desktop Configuration (claude_desktop_config.json)

For Claude Desktop, add to your configuration file:

{
    "mcpServers": {
        "university-support": {
            "command": "python",
            "args": [
                "c:/Users/segayle/repos/edu/47doors/labs/07-mcp-server/solution/mcp_server.py"
            ],
            "env": {
                "AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT": "https://your-openai.openai.azure.com/",
                "AZURE_OPENAI_KEY": "your-api-key",
                "AZURE_SEARCH_ENDPOINT": "https://your-search.search.windows.net",
                "AZURE_SEARCH_KEY": "your-search-key",
                "AZURE_SEARCH_INDEX": "university-kb"
            }
        }
    }
}


## Environment Variables

Alternatively, create a .env file in the solution directory:

# .env file
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=https://your-openai.openai.azure.com/
AZURE_OPENAI_KEY=your-api-key-here
AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT=gpt-4o
AZURE_SEARCH_ENDPOINT=https://your-search.search.windows.net
AZURE_SEARCH_KEY=your-search-key-here
AZURE_SEARCH_INDEX=university-kb


## Testing the Server

To test the server standalone:

1. Set environment variables or create .env file
2. Run: python mcp_server.py
3. The server will start and wait for MCP protocol messages on stdin

For interactive testing, you can use the MCP Inspector:
    npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector python mcp_server.py


## Available Tools

After connecting, the following tools are available:

1. university_support_query(query, session_id?)
   - Process queries through the full agent pipeline
   - Maintains conversation context with session_id

2. check_department_hours(department_id)
   - Get department contact info and business hours
   - Shows if department is currently open

3. create_support_ticket(title, description, department?, priority?, ...)
   - Create tickets for human follow-up
   - Returns ticket ID for tracking

4. search_knowledge_base(query, top_k?, use_hybrid?)
   - Direct RAG search against the knowledge base
   - Returns ranked document matches

5. list_departments()
   - List all available departments and their IDs
   - Useful for discovering available routing options
