# Lab 02 - Azure MCP Setup

**Duration:** 30 minutes
**Prerequisites:** Lab 00 completed

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lab, you will be able to:

1. **Configure Azure MCP Server for Copilot** - Set up the Model Context Protocol server to enable natural language interactions with Azure resources
2. **Test natural language Azure queries** - Use @azure queries in VS Code to interact with your Azure environment through Copilot

---

## What is MCP (Model Context Protocol)?

The **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is an open standard that enables AI assistants like GitHub Copilot to interact with external tools and data sources. Think of MCP as a universal adapter that allows AI models to:

- **Query external systems** - Access databases, APIs, and cloud resources
- **Execute actions** - Perform operations on your behalf (with your permission)
- **Retrieve context** - Pull in relevant information to inform AI responses

### Why MCP Matters for Azure Development

Without MCP, asking Copilot "What resources are in my resource group?" would require you to:
1. Open a terminal
2. Run `az resource list --resource-group myRG`
3. Parse the JSON output
4. Copy relevant information back to your conversation

With Azure MCP Server configured, you can simply type `@azure What resources are in my resource group?` and get a natural language response directly in VS Code.

### MCP Architecture

```
+------------------+       +------------------+       +------------------+
|   GitHub         |       |   Azure MCP      |       |   Azure          |
|   Copilot        | <---> |   Server         | <---> |   Resource       |
|   (VS Code)      |  MCP  |   (Local)        |  REST |   Manager        |
+------------------+       +------------------+       +------------------+
                                    |
                                    v
                           +------------------+
                           |   Azure CLI      |
                           |   Credentials    |
                           +------------------+
```

The Azure MCP Server acts as a bridge between Copilot and Azure, translating natural language queries into Azure API calls and formatting responses for human consumption.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Verify Azure CLI Authentication

Before installing the MCP server, ensure you are authenticated with Azure CLI:

```bash
# Check current login status
az account show

# If not logged in, authenticate
az login

# Verify the correct subscription is selected
az account list --output table
```

You should see your subscription listed with `IsDefault` set to `True`.

### Step 2: Install Azure MCP Server

The Azure MCP Server is distributed as an npm package. Install it globally:

```bash
# Install the Azure MCP Server
npm install -g @azure/mcp-server
```

Verify the installation:

```bash
# Check that the MCP server is installed
npx @azure/mcp-server --version
```

You should see a version number (e.g., `1.x.x`).

### Step 3: Configure VS Code Settings

Open VS Code settings to enable MCP support for GitHub Copilot.

1. Open VS Code
2. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+P` (macOS)
3. Type "Preferences: Open Settings (JSON)" and select it
4. Add the following configuration:

```json
{
  "github.copilot.chat.experimental.mcp.enabled": true,
  "github.copilot.chat.experimental.mcp.servers": {
    "azure": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@azure/mcp-server"],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
```

> **Note:** The MCP feature may be in preview. Check the GitHub Copilot documentation for the latest configuration syntax.

### Step 4: Add MCP Configuration to Copilot Settings

For project-specific MCP configuration, create or update the `.vscode/mcp.json` file in your workspace:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "azure": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@azure/mcp-server"],
      "description": "Azure Resource Manager MCP Server"
    }
  }
}
```

This configuration tells Copilot to use the Azure MCP Server when you prefix queries with `@azure`.

### Step 5: Restart VS Code

After making configuration changes:

1. Close VS Code completely
2. Reopen VS Code
3. Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` / `Cmd+Shift+P`)
4. Run "Developer: Reload Window" if the MCP server doesn't initialize

### Step 6: Test @azure Queries

Open GitHub Copilot Chat in VS Code and test the following queries:

#### Basic Connectivity Test

```
@azure List my subscriptions
```

**Expected Response:** A list of Azure subscriptions associated with your account.

#### Resource Group Query

```
@azure What resource groups exist in my subscription?
```

**Expected Response:** A list of resource groups with their names and locations.

#### Resource Inventory

```
@azure List all resources in the [your-resource-group] resource group
```

**Expected Response:** A detailed list of Azure resources including their types, names, and locations.

#### Service-Specific Queries

Try these additional queries to explore MCP capabilities:

```
@azure What App Services do I have deployed?
```

```
@azure Show me the configuration for my OpenAI resource
```

```
@azure What is the pricing tier of my Azure AI Search service?
```

## Troubleshooting

### MCP Server Not Found

**Problem:** `npx @azure/mcp-server --version` returns "command not found" or similar error

**Solution:**
1. Verify npm is installed: `npm --version`
2. Reinstall the MCP server: `npm install -g @azure/mcp-server`
3. Check your PATH includes npm global packages
4. On Windows, try running in a new terminal after installation

### @azure Queries Return "No MCP Server Found"

**Problem:** Copilot doesn't recognize the @azure prefix

**Solution:**
1. Verify VS Code settings are saved correctly
2. Reload VS Code window: `Ctrl+Shift+P` > "Developer: Reload Window"
3. Check that the GitHub Copilot extension is up to date
4. Ensure you have GitHub Copilot Chat enabled (not just Copilot completions)

### Authentication Errors

**Problem:** @azure queries return "Authentication failed" or "Access denied"

**Solution:**
1. Re-authenticate with Azure CLI: `az login`
2. Verify correct subscription: `az account set --subscription "Your Subscription Name"`
3. Check that your account has Reader permissions on the resources you're querying
4. Ensure your Azure CLI token hasn't expired: `az account get-access-token`

### MCP Server Crashes or Times Out

**Problem:** Queries hang or the MCP server crashes

**Solution:**
1. Check VS Code Output panel for MCP-related errors
2. Run the MCP server manually to see error output:
   ```bash
   npx @azure/mcp-server
   ```
3. Ensure you have a stable network connection to Azure
4. Try increasing timeout in VS Code settings if available

### Copilot Chat Not Available

**Problem:** GitHub Copilot Chat panel doesn't appear

**Solution:**
1. Verify you have a GitHub Copilot subscription with Chat access
2. Install the "GitHub Copilot Chat" extension separately if needed
3. Sign out and back into GitHub in VS Code
4. Check the VS Code Extensions panel for any Copilot errors

### Queries Return Empty or Incorrect Results

**Problem:** @azure queries work but return unexpected data

**Solution:**
1. Verify you're querying the correct subscription: `az account show`
2. Check that resources exist in the queried scope
3. Try more specific queries with resource group names
4. Ensure your account has appropriate RBAC permissions

### Windows-Specific Issues

**Problem:** MCP server doesn't start on Windows

**Solution:**
1. Run VS Code as Administrator (temporarily, for testing)
2. Check Windows Firewall isn't blocking the connection
3. Try using Command Prompt instead of PowerShell
4. Verify Node.js is in your system PATH: `where node`

## How MCP Enhances Your Workflow

With Azure MCP configured, you can now:

| Traditional Workflow | MCP-Enhanced Workflow |
|---------------------|----------------------|
| Open Azure Portal | Ask `@azure` in VS Code |
| Navigate through menus | Natural language query |
| Copy/paste resource IDs | Get inline responses |
| Switch between tools | Stay in your IDE |
| Manual JSON parsing | AI-formatted answers |

### Example Workflow Integration

When building your AI agents in later labs, you can use MCP to:

```
@azure What is the endpoint URL for my Azure OpenAI resource?
```

Then immediately use that information in your code without leaving VS Code.
