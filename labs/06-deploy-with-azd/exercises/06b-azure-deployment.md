# Exercise 06b: Azure Deployment

**Duration:** 60 minutes
**Objective:** Deploy your containerized application to Azure using Azure Developer CLI (azd)

---

## Overview

In this exercise, you will use Azure Developer CLI to provision Azure infrastructure and deploy your application with a single command. By the end, your AI agent will be running in Azure Container Apps.

---

## Prerequisites

- [ ] Exercise 06a completed (local Docker test successful)
- [ ] Azure subscription with Contributor access
- [ ] Azure CLI installed (`az --version`)
- [ ] Azure Developer CLI installed (`azd version`)

---

## Task 1: Install Azure Developer CLI (10 minutes)

### 1.1 Check if azd is Installed

```bash
azd version
```

If installed, you'll see output like:
```
azd version 1.5.0 (commit abc123)
```

### 1.2 Install azd (if needed)

**Windows (PowerShell as Administrator):**
```powershell
winget install microsoft.azd
```

**macOS:**
```bash
brew tap azure/azd && brew install azd
```

**Linux:**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://aka.ms/install-azd.sh | bash
```

### 1.3 Verify Installation

```bash
azd version
```

**Checkpoint:** azd version command shows version number.

---

## Task 2: Authenticate with Azure (5 minutes)

### 2.1 Login to Azure

```bash
azd auth login
```

This opens a browser window. Sign in with your Azure credentials.

**Expected:** After successful login:
```
Logged in to Azure.
```

### 2.2 Verify Azure CLI Authentication (Optional)

```bash
az account show
```

**Expected:** Shows your Azure subscription details.

### 2.3 Set Subscription (if multiple)

If you have multiple subscriptions:

```bash
# List subscriptions
az account list --output table

# Set the correct one
az account set --subscription "<subscription-name-or-id>"
```

**Checkpoint:** `azd auth login` succeeds and shows correct account.

---

## Task 3: Configure azd Environment (10 minutes)

### 3.1 Review azure.yaml

Verify the `azure.yaml` file exists in your project root:

```bash
cat azure.yaml
```

**Expected contents:**
```yaml
name: university-front-door-agent
metadata:
  template: university-front-door-agent@0.0.1

services:
  backend:
    project: ./backend
    language: python
    host: containerapp
    docker:
      path: Dockerfile

  frontend:
    project: ./frontend
    language: js
    host: staticwebapp

infra:
  provider: bicep
  path: ./infra
  module: main
```

### 3.2 Initialize azd (if needed)

If you haven't initialized azd in this project:

```bash
azd init
```

Follow the prompts to confirm project settings.

### 3.3 Create a New Environment

```bash
# Create a development environment
azd env new dev
```

### 3.4 Set Environment Variables

```bash
# Set Azure region
azd env set AZURE_LOCATION eastus

# View current environment
azd env get-values
```

### 3.5 Choose a Unique Name

Azure resource names must be globally unique. Set a unique prefix:

```bash
# Use your initials or team name
azd env set AZURE_ENV_NAME frontdoor-<your-initials>
```

**Checkpoint:** `azd env get-values` shows your configuration.

---

## Task 4: Provision Infrastructure (15 minutes)

### 4.1 Preview Infrastructure (Optional)

Before provisioning, you can preview what will be created:

```bash
azd provision --preview
```

This shows the Bicep deployment plan without executing it.

### 4.2 Run azd up

The `azd up` command provisions infrastructure AND deploys your application:

```bash
azd up
```

### 4.3 Monitor Provisioning Progress

The command will show progress:

```
Provisioning Azure resources (azd provision)

Provisioning Azure resources can take some time.

  (✓) Done: Resource group: rg-frontdoor-dev-eastus
  (✓) Done: Log Analytics workspace: log-frontdoor-dev
  (✓) Done: Container Apps Environment: cae-frontdoor-dev
  (✓) Done: Container Registry: acrfrontdoordev
  (✓) Done: Azure OpenAI: aoai-frontdoor-dev
  ...

Deploying services (azd deploy)

  (✓) Done: Building container image
  (✓) Done: Pushing to registry
  (✓) Done: Service backend

SUCCESS: Your application was provisioned and deployed to Azure.
```

**Note:** This process takes 10-15 minutes on first run.

### 4.4 Handle Provisioning Errors

If provisioning fails:

```bash
# Check detailed error
azd provision --debug

# Common issues:
# - Subscription doesn't have required resource providers
# - Region doesn't support certain services
# - Quota limits exceeded
```

**Checkpoint:** `azd up` completes with "SUCCESS" message.

---

## Task 5: Verify Deployment (10 minutes)

### 5.1 Get Service Endpoints

```bash
azd show
```

**Expected output:**
```
Showing deployed resources for environment: dev

Service           Endpoint
backend           https://ca-backend-xxxxx.azurecontainerapps.io
frontend          https://frontdoor-xxxxx.azurestaticapps.net
```

### 5.2 Store Backend URL

```bash
# Get the backend URL
BACKEND_URL=$(azd env get-value AZURE_CONTAINERAPP_URL)
echo "Backend URL: $BACKEND_URL"
```

### 5.3 Test Health Endpoint

```bash
# Test the health endpoint
curl -s "$BACKEND_URL/api/health" | jq .
```

**Expected response:**
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z",
  "services": {
    "llm": {"status": "up", "latency_ms": 50},
    "ticketing": {"status": "up", "latency_ms": 30},
    "knowledge_base": {"status": "up", "latency_ms": 25},
    "session_store": {"status": "up", "latency_ms": 10}
  }
}
```

### 5.4 Test Chat Endpoint

```bash
# Test the chat API
curl -s -X POST "$BACKEND_URL/api/chat" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "Hello!", "session_id": null}' | jq .
```

**Expected:** JSON response with agent reply and session_id.

### 5.5 Access Frontend

If frontend was deployed:

```bash
FRONTEND_URL=$(azd env get-value AZURE_STATICWEBAPP_URL)
echo "Open in browser: $FRONTEND_URL"
```

### 5.6 Verify in Azure Portal

1. Navigate to [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com)
2. Find your resource group: `rg-frontdoor-dev-eastus`
3. Verify all resources are created:
   - Container Apps Environment
   - Container App (backend)
   - Container Registry
   - Log Analytics Workspace
   - Static Web App (if frontend)

**Checkpoint:** Health endpoint returns 200 with healthy status.

---

## Task 6: View Logs and Monitoring (10 minutes)

### 6.1 Stream Container Logs

```bash
# Get resource group name
RG=$(azd env get-value AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP)

# Stream logs from backend
az containerapp logs show \
  --name ca-backend \
  --resource-group $RG \
  --follow
```

Press `Ctrl+C` to stop streaming.

### 6.2 View System Logs

```bash
az containerapp logs show \
  --name ca-backend \
  --resource-group $RG \
  --type system
```

### 6.3 Check Container Status

```bash
az containerapp show \
  --name ca-backend \
  --resource-group $RG \
  --query "properties.runningStatus"
```

**Expected:** `"Running"`

### 6.4 View Metrics in Portal

1. Go to Azure Portal
2. Navigate to your Container App
3. Click "Metrics" in the left menu
4. View:
   - Requests per second
   - Response time
   - CPU/Memory usage

### 6.5 Query Logs in Log Analytics

1. Go to Azure Portal
2. Find your Log Analytics workspace
3. Click "Logs"
4. Run query:

```kusto
ContainerAppConsoleLogs_CL
| where ContainerAppName_s contains "backend"
| project TimeGenerated, Log_s
| order by TimeGenerated desc
| take 50
```

**Checkpoint:** Can view container logs and verify application is running.

---

## Task 7: Make a Code Change and Redeploy (Optional)

### 7.1 Make a Small Change

Edit `backend/app/main.py` to update the version:

```python
@app.get("/api/health")
async def health():
    return {
        "status": "healthy",
        "version": "1.0.1",  # Changed from 1.0.0
        "environment": os.getenv("ENVIRONMENT", "development")
    }
```

### 7.2 Redeploy

```bash
# Deploy only (no infrastructure changes)
azd deploy
```

This is faster than `azd up` because it only rebuilds and deploys the container.

### 7.3 Verify the Change

```bash
curl -s "$BACKEND_URL/api/health" | jq .version
```

**Expected:** `"1.0.1"`

---

## Task 8: Clean Up (When Done with Lab)

### 8.1 Delete All Resources

**Warning:** This permanently deletes all Azure resources!

```bash
azd down
```

Confirm when prompted.

### 8.2 Verify Deletion

```bash
az group show --name $RG 2>/dev/null || echo "Resource group deleted"
```

---

## Verification Checklist

Before completing Lab 06, confirm:

- [ ] `azd auth login` succeeded
- [ ] `azd up` completed without errors
- [ ] `azd show` displays service endpoints
- [ ] Health endpoint returns `{"status": "healthy", ...}`
- [ ] Can view container logs in Azure
- [ ] Container shows "Running" status
- [ ] (Optional) Redeploy works after code change

---

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Issue: "azd up" fails with authentication error

```bash
# Re-authenticate
azd auth logout
azd auth login

# Also ensure Azure CLI is authenticated
az login
```

### Issue: Container fails health check

```bash
# Check container logs
az containerapp logs show \
  --name ca-backend \
  --resource-group $RG \
  --type console

# Verify the app starts correctly by checking startup logs
```

### Issue: "Quota exceeded" error

```bash
# Try a different region
azd env set AZURE_LOCATION westus2
azd up
```

### Issue: Build fails in Azure Container Registry

```bash
# Verify Docker builds locally first
docker compose build

# Check ACR build logs
az acr task logs --registry <acr-name>
```

### Issue: Environment variables not set in Container App

```bash
# Check current environment variables
az containerapp show \
  --name ca-backend \
  --resource-group $RG \
  --query "properties.template.containers[0].env"

# Update manually if needed
az containerapp update \
  --name ca-backend \
  --resource-group $RG \
  --set-env-vars "KEY=value"
```
