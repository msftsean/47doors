# Squad Decisions

## Active Decisions

### Model Selection Directive
**Timestamp:** 2026-03-13T13-09-59  
**Authority:** User (msftsean via Copilot)  
**Decision:** 
- Code-writing agents (Tank, Switch, Mouse, Neo): use `claude-sonnet-4.6`
- Non-code agents (Scribe, documentation, evals, Morpheus when not reviewing): use `claude-haiku-4.6`

**Rationale:** Optimize for cost vs. quality based on task type. Code work requires full Sonnet capability; administrative/documentation work can use faster Haiku model.

## Governance

- All meaningful changes require team consensus
- Document architectural decisions here
- Keep history focused on work, decisions focused on direction
