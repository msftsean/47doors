```env
# Azure Search aliases (lab code expects AZURE_SEARCH_* prefix)
AZURE_SEARCH_ENDPOINT=https://search-47doors-user60.search.windows.net
AZURE_SEARCH_KEY=*****
AZURE_SEARCH_INDEX=university-kb

# Azure OpenAI aliases (some code expects AZURE_OPENAI_KEY)
AZURE_OPENAI_KEY=<same as AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY>
```

---

## Issues Resolved During Testing

| Issue | Resolution |
|-------|------------|
| `AZURE_SEARCH_*` env vars not found | Added aliases in backend/.env |
| `AZURE_OPENAI_KEY` not found | Added alias pointing to API key |
| Invalid select parameter in search | Changed from `[content_field, "*"]` to explicit field list |
| DeploymentNotFound for gpt-4 | Changed default model to gpt-4o |
| DeploymentNotFound for text-embedding-ada-002 | User deployed model in Azure AI Foundry |

---

## Azure Model Deployments Required

| Model | Deployment Name | Purpose |
|-------|-----------------|---------|
| GPT-4o | `gpt-4o` | Chat completions, intent classification, response generation |
| text-embedding-ada-002 | `text-embedding-ada-002` | Document and query embeddings (1536 dimensions) |

---

## Files Modified During Testing

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `backend/.env` | Added Azure credentials and aliases |
| `labs/00-setup/.env` | Added Azure credentials |

| `labs/05-agent-orchestration/test_lab05.py` | Created for pipeline testing |

---

## Recommendations

### For Hackathon Participants

1. **Create Azure Deployments First**: Before starting Lab 04, ensure both `gpt-4o` and `text-embedding-ada-002` are deployed in Azure AI Foundry

2. **Set Environment Variables**: Copy the `.env` template and add all required Azure credentials

3. **Run Index Setup**: Use `setup_index.py` to create the search index and ingest KB articles before testing the RAG pipeline

### For Hackathon Organizers

1. **Pre-provision Azure Resources**: Consider pre-creating Azure OpenAI and AI Search resources for participants

2. **Document Model Requirements**: Clearly state that both `gpt-4o` and `text-embedding-ada-002` deployments are required

3. **Include Environment Variable Reference**: Provide a complete list of required environment variables with aliases
