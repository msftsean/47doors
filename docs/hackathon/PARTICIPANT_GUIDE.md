# 47 Doors Hackathon - Participant Guide

Welcome to the 47 Doors Hackathon! This guide will help you get started and navigate through the labs.

---

## What You're Building

You will build a **three-agent AI system** that eliminates the "47 Front Doors" problem in university student support. Instead of students navigating multiple disconnected support channels, they interact with one intelligent interface that detects intent, routes requests to the correct department, retrieves knowledge base articles, and creates support tickets automatically. By the end of this hackathon, you will have a working agent pipeline deployed to Azure that can classify student queries, search a knowledge base with RAG, and orchestrate multi-turn conversations.

## How to Get Help

1. **Raise your hand** - Instructors and lab assistants are circulating
2. **Check the solution folder** - Each lab has a `solution/` directory with reference implementations
3. **Use the hackathon chat channel** - Post questions for peer support
4. **Review troubleshooting sections** - Each lab README includes common issues and fixes
5. **Pair with a neighbor** - Two heads are better than one!

## Assessment Criteria

Your progress will be evaluated on these deliverables:

| Lab | Key Deliverable | Success Criteria |
|-----|-----------------|------------------|
| 00 | Environment verification | `verify_environment.py` passes all checks |
| 01 | Intent classifier | >90% accuracy on sample queries |
| 02 | MCP configuration | `@azure` queries work in Copilot |
| 03 | Specification document | Complete SPEC.md with acceptance criteria |
| 04 | RAG pipeline | Hybrid search returns relevant KB articles with citations |
| 05 | Agent orchestration | Full pipeline handles multi-turn conversations |
| 06 | Azure deployment | Agent deployed and health check responds |

## Tips for Success

1. **Read the full lab README** before starting each exercise
2. **Don't skip Lab 00** - environment issues will slow you down later
3. **Commit frequently** - save your progress as you go
4. **Ask for help early** - don't struggle alone for more than 10 minutes
5. **Use Copilot liberally** - that's what it's here for!

Good luck, and have fun building the future of university support!
